# üèò Nearby Neighborhoods

Present is all about location, location, location! Our servers must efficiently find 
circles based on a user's location. During this challenge, instead of circles,
you'll search for _neighborhoods_ near a given location. 

## Instructions

Please fork this repo, and submit your solution in the form of a pull request.

* You can build and run the code with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or just about any IDE. We ‚ù§Ô∏è¬†[IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
* Feel free to use and demonstrate your knowledge of 3rd party libraries!
* Our servers are multi-threaded. Your code should be scaleable and safe for concurrent use.
* We follow [Google's Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). Please do the same.
* We write code once but read it many times. Please consider the maintainability of your solution.

Now for the challenge:

1. Make [`Location.distanceTo()`](https://github.com/presentco/nearby-neighborhoods/blob/master/java/src/main/java/present/Location.java)
compute the [great-circle distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance)
so that [`LocationTest`](https://github.com/presentco/nearby-neighborhoods/blob/master/java/src/test/java/present/LocationTest.java)
passes.

2. Make [`Search.near()`](https://github.com/presentco/nearby-neighborhoods/blob/master/java/src/main/java/present/Search.java)
return the neighborhoods closest to a location so that [`SearchTest`](https://github.com/presentco/nearby-neighborhoods/blob/master/java/src/test/java/present/SearchTest.java)
passes.

3. Computing distances can add up! Make sure we're not performing duplicate distance computations during `Search.near()`. How many distances do we compute?

4. What's the time complexity of `Search.near()`? It's reasonable assume that we'll query neighborhoods far more often than we'll add new neighborhoods. Feel free to pre-process the neighborhood data and make retrieval more efficient. Use whatever data structures, algorithms and libraries you like. Can you beat `O(n log(n))`? Can you achieve `O(1)`? Strut your stuff! üíÉ

5. Create a server that returns a given number of neighborhoods closest to a given location. At Present, we use Protocol Buffers (and [Wire](https://github.com/square/wire)) for our server APIs.
